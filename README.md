# Countdown-Timer
### This is a simple countdown timer web application made with JavaScript that displays the remaining time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds. It takes a specific date and time as input, and then calculates the time difference between the current date and the input date. The countdown timer then displays the remaining time left until the input date in the format of days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
## Installation:
### To use this countdown timer web application, you can simply download the source code files and save them to your local computer. Then, open the index.html file in a web browser, and you will see the countdown timer displayed on the webpage.
## Usage:
### To set the countdown timer, you can modify the "targetDate" variable in the script.js file with your desired date and time in the following format: "yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss". For example, if you want the countdown timer to countdown to January 1st, 2024 at 12:00:00 PM, you would set the targetDate variable to "2024-01-01T12:00:00".
